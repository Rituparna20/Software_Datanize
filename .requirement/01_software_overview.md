To build a web-based tool that simplifies data preprocessing for supervised machine learning workflows. 
It includes Excel dataset handling, missing value treatment, encoding, visualization, feature selection, train-test splitting.
For unsupervised learning, image labeling with YAML export is done.

Application Flow:
Upload Excel file
Analyze & handle missing values
Encode categorical features
Visualize data (charts + PDF export)
Select features (PCA, PLS, Correlation)
Perform train-test split (70/30) and return the clean data with train test split csv.
Upload image folder
Auto-label the images and export .yaml file.
